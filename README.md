# hello-world

Hello to everyone!

AnimeHeart here, I'm a university student who loves programming. I have programming knowledge for some 
programming languages and I'm interested in learning about other languages. I love learning new things and improving my skills.
I love programming so much that I just currently declared a minor in design and development of video games at the university. I'll also be taking a few graphic design classes. It doesn't matter how much you know because the world of technology keeps improving and expanding to a high rate that we need to be constantly learning to be up to date in the world we live in. I'm looking forward to do projects and get to know some of you along the way.
